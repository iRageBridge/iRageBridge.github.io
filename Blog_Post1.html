<h1>Blog Post 1 (21/03/15)</h1>
	<p>
	As of now, i have just about got the parallax working 
	for this project. I have the character facing forward and 
	turning on the right arrow event. There are many bugs, for 
	example the timer that seems to be on the stage, while the 
	character is walking it will reset after 8 or 9 seconds, 
	I will have to look into that. And also there are some bugs
	when it comes to walking to the right, it is very glitchy.
	I am about to add the go to and play for parts of the walk 
	for example the jumping and other animations I have ideas 
	for, for example when he is idle for more than a few seconds
	I will have him shaking some maracas, Over all im am pretty 
	confident that I will sort out all these bugs and glitches, 
	with all the projects it is very difficult to a lot a time 
	frame for one project along especially with work and family 
	commitments on top of that, but again, I am confident of 
	delivering a fully functional project at the end of this 
	college year. I will add a link to my current progress below.

     </h1>Blog Post 2 (5/4/15)</h1>
    <p>
    	This is the second blog post in my interactive programming project. As of how
    	there have been few visible changes, but some things going on behind the scenes that
    	should be addressed. I have removed almost all "addChild()" and "removeChild()" functions from
    	the code, and replaced them with a much more pracitcal "gotoAndStop()" functionality. While this
    	does not make a huge difference to the way the character reacts, it does make it much easier to understand 
    	and to code. It also gives the option to add in a 3/4 view as a transition from the front view to the
    	side view for walking. I have also added marracas to the front and 3/4 view to correspond with those that are
    	in view on the side view of the character. Things to be completed in the coming weeks are the jump animation,
    	the addicion of a "dead zone" which i am still to figure out, some sort of interaction as well as a test hit object
    	which the character will jump on. I all embedd a .swf to the current version of my project below.
