	<p>
	As of now, i have just about got the parallax working 
	for this project. I have the character facing forward and 
	turning on the right arrow event. There are many bugs, for 
	example the timer that seems to be on the stage, while the 
	character is walking it will reset after 8 or 9 seconds, 
	I will have to look into that. And also there are some bugs
	when it comes to walking to the right, it is very glitchy.
	I am about to add the go to and play for parts of the walk 
	for example the jumping and other animations I have ideas 
	for, for example when he is idle for more than a few seconds
	I will have him shaking some maracas, Over all im am pretty 
	confident that I will sort out all these bugs and glitches, 
	with all the projects it is very difficult to a lot a time 
	frame for one project along especially with work and family 
	commitments on top of that, but again, I am confident of 
	delivering a fully functional project at the end of this 
	college year. I will add a link to my current progress below.
